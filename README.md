I am a highly driven, self-motivated, hardworking individual, with the ability to work well under pressure. 
After graduating from university, I moved to Japan where I lived for a just under three years teaching English to a variety of age groups. I returned to England for a short while and gained experienced as a Business Development Manager before leaving to travel around New Zealand and Australia. I've since had customer-service based roles which have been both remotely online and in retail. 

I have recently completed the Makers Academy bootcamp, a 16 week, intensive software development course and have gained skills to become a full-stack developer. 

I blogged about my journey at Makers [here](https://medium.com/@joewmcgarry)

## Skills

**Quick learner**
I am a quick learner and always eager to learn new things. When I lived in Japan, I taught myself Japanese in my free time using a variety of books and language exchanges. I have also taught myself how to use the Adobe Suite through online courses and tutorials. During my time at Makers, I picked up new languages and concepts quickly that allowed me to complete the tasks set.

**Team Player**
Throughout the Makers from pairing to the numerous group projects, I have was able to work effectively and efficiently in the allocated teams. Using Agile philosophy, we made the projects fun, challenging and incredibly rewarding ensuring the workload was spread evenly amongst the team members. 

**Attention to detail**
During my time teaching English, I had to identify grammar, spelling or any other mistakes by students in order to explain why it was incorrect and encourage the students to think of the solution using what they knew about the English language. 

My role at Auckland Council also required me to be accurate when lodging the building consent forms. This included ensuring the correct plot of land had been selected in the application form and within the system, that customer details were correct and that the payment had been made and allocated to that application. I also trained the team on correct procedures prior to leaving.
