## Joe McGarry

I am a highly driven, self-motivated, hardworking individual, with the ability to work well under pressure. 
After graduating from university, I moved to Japan where I lived for a just under three years teaching English to a variety of age groups. I returned to England for a short while and gained experienced as a Business Development Manager before leaving to travel around New Zealand and Australia. I've since had customer-service based roles which have been both remotely online and in retail. 

I am currently enrolled in Makers Academy, a 12 week software development bootcamp, to become a full-stack developer.
